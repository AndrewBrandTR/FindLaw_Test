# About

The FLRepoChecks workflow is here to check important characteristics of a FindLaw repo. The most important is that it runs 'on fork', so it will run on a repository that uses this repository 'as a template'.

## :no_entry: WARNING :no_entry:

:exclamation: If the workflow is updated, and has not run successfully in THIS repo, it will NOT run in a forked repo. :exclamation:

So run the action after any updates.
